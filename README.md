In this profile you will find some coding I've wrote for learning purposes. I'm investing increasingly more time on it. At work, I've been with my head down into Java, Back-end, for the most part of my career, with some short (but rewarding) experience with PHP, Javascript, JQuery and Bootstrap. I'm now learning Python - and very happy about that. For the near future, I am aiming at learning Angular and Node JS. I've been think of Ada and C++.
