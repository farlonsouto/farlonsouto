Here you will find some coding I've wrote for learning purposes. I'm investing increasingly more time on it. At work, I've been with my head down into Java, back-end, for the most part of my career. I had some short (but rewarding) experience with PHP, Javascript, JQuery and Bootstrap. I'm now learning Python - and very happy about that. For the near future, I am aiming at learning Angular and Node JS, as part of the classic full stack, but also Ada looks interesting, for real-time, mission-critical systems. It all depends: I wanna make my tools' scope wider.
